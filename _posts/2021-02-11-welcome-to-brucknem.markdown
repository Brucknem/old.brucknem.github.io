# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching for my [Master Thesis](https://github.com/Brucknem/HyperCRL){:target="_blank"} at the [Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Systems](https://www.in.tum.de/en/i06/home/){:target="_blank"}.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a student research assistant at the [Providentia++](https://innovation-mobility.com/en/){:target="_blank"} project.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to Computer Vision, Continual Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. I'm happy to discuss any topic and even more if I can help you. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: The email related to this account if visible. Otherwise create an issue on any of my projects and I will respond to you.
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are a lot of nice organisations like [4Ocean](https://www.4ocean.com/){:target="_blank"} or [German Zero](https://www.germanzero.de){:target="_blank"} that fight against worldwide pollution and climate change. They are always happy to get support.
